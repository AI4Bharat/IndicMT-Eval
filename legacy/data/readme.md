The annotated MQM data is available at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HEwlBTLvN2NOXLxiBpIt_GVdHkjyvIo8DvQrncgto74/edit?usp=sharing 

The spreadsheet format of the data (.xlsx file) contains the richest amount of information containing the source sentence, reference translation, translation output by 
a model, along with the errors highlighted by colors, with the corresponding error type and error severity indicated in the same colored cells. 

The color information is not rendered in the csv format of the data, which is still useful for tasks like computing correlations of the scores with various metrics.
We also release the html format which is more helpful for processing the highlighted errors in each translation for other applications and future research.
